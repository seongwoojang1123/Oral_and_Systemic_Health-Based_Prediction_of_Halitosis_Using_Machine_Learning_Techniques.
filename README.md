# Neural Network and Machine Learning Prediction of Halitosis from Oral and Systemic Health Data

This repository contains the official code for the study  
**"Predicting Subjective Halitosis Using Tabular Health Data and Transformer-based Models"**  
by Yeon-Hee Lee, Seongwoo Jang, Seonggwang Jeon, Tae-Seok Kim, and David Keith.  
The repository includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization modules for predicting subjective halitosis using machine learning and deep learning algorithms.

## Project Overview

Halitosis significantly impacts social interaction and quality of life.  
This project explores the potential of structured clinical data to classify individuals with subjective halitosis.

Key aspects include:
- Feature engineering from oral health data
- Classical ML & Transformer-based model comparison
- AUROC and p-value evaluation across 7 feature conditions
